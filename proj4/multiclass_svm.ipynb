    "Open up a terminal window and navigate to the datasets folder inside the hw3 folder. Run the get_datasets.sh script. On my Mac, I just type in ./get_datasets.sh at the shell prompt. A new folder called cifar_10_batches_py will be created and it will contain 50000 labeled images for training and  10000 labeled images for testing. The function further partitions the  50000 training images into a train set and a validation set for selection of hyperparameters. We have provided a function to read this data in **data_utils.py**. Each image is a  32×32\n",
    "array of RGB triples. It is preprocessed by subtracting the mean image from all images. We flatten each image into a 1-dimensional array of size 3072 (i.e.,  32×32×3). Then a 1 is appended to the front of that vector to handle the intercept term. So the training set is a numpy matrix of size  49000×3073, the validation set is a matrix of size  1000×3073 and the set-aside test set is of size  10000×3073. We also have a random sample of 500 images from the training data to serve as a development set or dev set to test our gradient and loss function implementations."
